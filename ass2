Q1 What is an Array?
Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.

Q2 How do you declare an Array in java?
its a two step process
1) Declare a variable of the desired array type
2)must allocate the memory that will hold the array, using new, and assign it to the array variable.


Q3 What is the default value of Array for different data types?
 For primitive types like int , long , float the default value are zero ( 0 or 0.0 )
double 0.0

Q4 Can you change size of Array in java after creation?
If you create an array by initializing its values directly, the size will be the number of elements in it. 
Thus the size of the array is determined at the time of its creation or, initialization once 
it is done you cannot change the size of the array.

Q5 Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
No, you cannot use a negative integer as size.

Q6 Can you declare an Array without Array size?
yes, we can // how to answer//

Q7 Where does Array stored in JVM memory ?
heap area, because while allocating memory we use new keyword.

Q9 What is ArrayStoreException ? When this exception is thrown ?
ArrayStoreException is thrown at runtime in Java when an attempt is made to store the incorrect type of object in an array of objects. 
Since ArrayStoreException is an unchecked exception, it isn't typical to handle or declare it.
//uncheched exception --

Q10 What is the difference between ArrayStoreException andArrayOutOfBoundsException ?
ArrayStoreException is thrown if you are trying to add incompatible data type. 
For example, if you try to add an integer object to String Array, then ArrayStoreException is thrown. 
ArrayOutOfBoundsException is thrown when an attempt is made to access the Array with illegal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array

Q11 What are the advantages of Array ?
1.Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.
2.In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number.
3.Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence there is no chance of extra memory being allocated
in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays.

Q12 What are the disadvantages of Array?
1.The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance.
An array is a static structure (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified. 
The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.
2.Insertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and 
the shifting operation is costly.
3.Allocating more memory than the requirement leads to wastage of memory space and less allocation of memory also leads to a problem.

Q15 Write a program to print elements of Array ?
public class Array {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
{
            System.out.println(array[i]);
        }
       /* for (int element: array) {
            System.out.println(element);
        } */
    }
}

Q18 Which is legal int[] arr or int arr[] ?
both

Q19 Write a program to throw ArrayOutOfBoundsException?
public class Array {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for(int i=0;i<6;i++)
{
            System.out.println(array[i]);
        }
       /* for (int element: array) {
            System.out.println(element);
        } */
    }
}
